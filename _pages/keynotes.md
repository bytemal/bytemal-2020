        <h6>BIO</h6>
        <p>Ruud JG van Sloun (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (cum laude) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree (cum laude) from the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2012, 2014, and 2018, respectively. Since then, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and since January 2020 a Kickstart-AI fellow at Philips Research, Eindhoven. From 2019-2020 he was also a Visiting Professor with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. He is a NWO Rubicon laurate and received a Google Faculty Research Award in 2020. His current research interests include artificial intelligence and deep learning for front-end (ultrasound) signal processing, model-based deep learning, compressed sensing, ultrasound imaging, and probabilistic signal and image analysis.</p>
        <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
        <p>His talk will elaborate on deep learning strategies in ultrasound systems, from the front-end to advanced applications, thereby discussing the possible impact of deep learning methodologies on many aspects of ultrasound imaging. In particular, it will outline methods that lie at the interface of signal acquisition and machine learning, exploiting both data structure (e.g. sparsity in some domain) and data dimensionality (big data) already at the raw radio-frequency channel stage. Several illustrative examples will be given, covering efficient and effective deep learning solutions for adaptive beamforming and adaptive spectral Doppler through artificial agents, learning of compressive encodings for color Doppler, and a framework for structured signal recovery by learning fast approximations of iterative minimization problems, with applications to clutter suppression and super-resolution ultrasound. These emerging technologies may have a considerable impact on ultrasound imaging, showing promise across key components in the receive processing chain.</p>
